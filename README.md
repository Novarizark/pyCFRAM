# pyCFRAM
pyCFRAM is a python-encapsulated implementation of the Climate Feedbackâ€“Response Analysis Method (CFRAM). We aims to build a user-friendly, high-efficient, and extendable interface for CFRAM users. pyCFRAM uses f2py, mpi4py, and multiprocessing packages to exploit maximum potential of the code parallelism without dramatically modify the original FORTRAN code.

For the CFRAM, please refer to [Lu and Cai (2009)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-008-0425-3), and [Cai and Lu (2009)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-008-0424-4).
